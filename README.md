In this study, we explore the significant advantages of incorporating diacritics into Arabic ASR systems, demonstrating their superior integration capabilities with other technologies compared to non-diacritic systems. Our approach leverages cutting-edge end-to-end deep learning methodologies, utilising Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and logarithmic Mel-Scale Filter Bank energies as acoustic features. Notably, this marks the first implementation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for diacritical Arabic automatic voice recognition.

We introduce a novel CTC-based ASR model, combining CNN-LSTM architecture with an attention-based end-to-end strategy to enhance diacritic handling in Arabic ASR. Furthermore, we address the unexplored domain of English-to-Arabic translation, driven by the growing demand resulting from factors like immigration and asylum seeking.

This research tackles the unique challenges posed by the linguistic, cultural, and systemic asymmetry between English and Arabic, with a specific focus on lexical translation approaches. We delve into common issues encountered during English-to-Arabic literature translation, including archaic words, specialized terminologies, and doublets and triplets. These domains demand expertise, professional training, and a deep understanding of linguistic systems, along with access to the latest electronic dictionaries and well-defined parallel corpora.

In conclusion, our study offers valuable insights and strategies to address the complexities of English-to-Arabic translation, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary expertise and state-of-the-art resources in this field.
